# Flex-Panel-Gallery

Project 5 of Wes Bos's 30 JavaScript projects in 30 days


This project includes a responsive flex pane gallery layout to display images dynamically. The images used in the gallery are from my personal trip to Thailand, showcasing various locations and experiences.

Feel free to explore the gallery for a visual tour of Thailand! https://symphonious-elf-4b3125.netlify.app/
